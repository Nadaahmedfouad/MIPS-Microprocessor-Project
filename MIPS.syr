WARNING:Xst:3012 - Available block RAM resources offer a maximum of two write ports. You are apparently describing a RAM with 4 separate write ports for signal <mem>. The RAM will be expanded on registers.
INFO:Xst:3019 - HDL ADVISOR - 256 flip-flops were inferred for signal <mem>. You may be trying to describe a RAM in a way that is incompatible with block and distributed RAM resources available on Xilinx devices, or with a specific template that is not supported. Please review the Xilinx resources documentation and the XST user manual for coding guidelines. Taking advantage of RAM resources will lead to improved device usage and reduced synthesis time.

WARNING:Xst:3001 - This design contains one or more registers or latches with an active
   asynchronous set and asynchronous reset. While this circuit can be built,
   it creates a sub-optimal implementation in terms of area, power and
   performance. For a more optimal implementation Xilinx highly recommends
   one of the following:

          1) Remove either the set or reset from all registers and latches if
             not needed for required functionality
          2) Modify the code in order to produce a synchronous set
             and/or reset (both is preferred)
          3) Use the -async_to_sync option to transform the asynchronous
             set/reset to synchronous operation
             (timing simulation highly recommended when using this option)

  Please refer to http://www.xilinx.com search string "Kintex7 asynchronous set/reset" for more details.

(*) These 10 clock signal(s) are generated by combinatorial logic,
and XST is not able to identify which are the primary clock signals.
Please use the CLOCK_SIGNAL constraint to specify the clock signal(s) generated by combinatorial logic.
INFO:Xst:2169 - HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
