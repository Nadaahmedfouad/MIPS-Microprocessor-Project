# ‚öôÔ∏è MIPS Microprocessor (VHDL ‚Äì Xilinx ISE)

## üìå Project Idea
This project implements a simplified **MIPS microprocessor** using **VHDL**.  
It was developed to understand the design of a pipelined RISC CPU, the integration of datapath and control units, and how instructions are executed at the hardware level.

The design follows the classic **5-stage pipeline architecture**:
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
3. **Execute (EX)**
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**
5. **Write Back (WB)**
